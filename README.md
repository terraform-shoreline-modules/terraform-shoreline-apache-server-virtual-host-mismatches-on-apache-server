### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Virtual Host Mismatches on Apache Server.
---

This incident type refers to frequent mismatches between the virtual hosts configured on an Apache server. This can cause issues with routing traffic to the intended web application or website, resulting in downtime or other problems. It is important to address these mismatches promptly to ensure the proper functioning of the server and any associated applications.

### Parameters
```shell
export VIRTUAL_HOST="PLACEHOLDER"

export URL="PLACEHOLDER"

export HOSTNAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export PORT="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_APACHE_CONFIG_FILES="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Apache configuration syntax errors
```shell
apachectl configtest
```

### Check Apache configuration for the specified <virtual_host>
```shell
apachectl -S | grep '${VIRTUAL_HOST}'
```

### Check the HTTP response headers of the specified URL <url>
```shell
curl -I ${URL}
```

### Check the DNS resolution of the specified <hostname>
```shell
nslookup ${HOSTNAME}
```

### Check if the specified <port> is open and listening
```shell
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep ':${PORT}'
```

### Check the Apache access log for requests to the specified <virtual_host>
```shell
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep '${VIRTUAL_HOST}'
```

## Repair

### Verify the Apache configuration files to ensure all the virtual host configurations are correct and consistent.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the path to the Apache configuration files

CONFIG_PATH=${PATH_TO_APACHE_CONFIG_FILES}



# Verify the configuration files for any errors

apache2ctl configtest



# If there are no errors, reload the Apache server

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then

    systemctl reload apache2

    echo "Apache configuration files have been reloaded."

else

    echo "There was an error in the Apache configuration files."
